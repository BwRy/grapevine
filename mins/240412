code coverage

OSX86 Leopard in virtualbox -> upgrade to Snow Leopard

>Compile Darwin

Workplan

- Something to analyse BSD and Mach syscall files.
- Start from basic fuzzer (Using fuzzing inputs similar to Android Kernel Fuzzer)
- modular, add in different fuzzing inputs (int, char, etc)
- Design a fuzzing algorithm

- Expand with network capabilities
- 'Cluster' Fuzzing
- Host <-> Guest
- VM control over network
