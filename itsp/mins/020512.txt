Technical stuff
functions:
parsing syscall headers/files

 -> get fuzz input that cause crash
 
--build (latest) kernel

Generic fuzzer.
Different fuzzing techniques.
 -> mutate valid inputs
 -> deterministically random input
 -> combine multiple of fuzzing
-> code coverage

Fuzzer for multi platform. 
Documentation is important.


Python import ctypes library (like leetmore)

kernel module to find data that created crash.
