Problem statement
 - Mac userbase is growing. The number or malware targeted at Mac OSX is growing as well. Security research on the Mac OSX platform has been gaining popularity recently in response to the malicious attacks. There is a need to develop tools for security research to find vulnerabilities within the Mac OSX operating system. Especially the XNU/Darwin kernel which is the main component of the Mac OSX operating system.

Proposed possible solutions/ideas.
