Narrated Dialogue
The darkness of night never falls. My days are a never ending cycle of day, dawn, and idiots. They drag their slow clumsy feet, stumbling about and babbling in that commercial, mindless drawl. And the world, le monde, she just lies there, a beat doxy woman with the glossy eyes, red beret, and mouth agape. A hint of tinny and manufactured but safe music leak from the buds of her uninspired, their heads bobbing in unison, not unlike mindless chaff taken by the wind in a wheatfield. Whose adversarial and amateur glassless glasses are torn to tatters and burned sky high in the unrelenting traffic of predictable order. Confusion, discomfort, misery, and pain through order. They offer all these things with their schedules, and their fancy gold-gilded stopwatches, and their international timezones. It is a time when Man would chase the light of Sol the Sun in his little aviary contraptions. But what of the light of the moon, la claire de lune? The light of the night never rises.


General Concept
Calming/Soothing impressionistic music playing over scenes depicting regular not-so-still life in the form of time lapses and wiggle stereoscopy as well as a side story in the form of short maybe subtitled scenes (probably done as improv of scenes from the film Primer) with an agitated cast juxtaposed by a sardonic, cynical, and satrical narration.
